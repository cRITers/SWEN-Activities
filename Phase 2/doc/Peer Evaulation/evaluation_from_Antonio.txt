Peer Evaluation from Antonio Butigan (For Josip Muzic)

10/10

I believe he did everything on his side, even more than he was supposed to. He managed to add his code to mine, so everything writes out correctly.

I enjoyed working with him on this project as I always learn a lot from working with him.
